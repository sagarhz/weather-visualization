Real-time generative weather-to-visual art system using WeatherAPI + p5.js
🌦️ Weather Visualization — Real-Time Generative Artwork

An interactive, data-driven artwork translating live weather conditions into evolving abstract forms.

🎨 Concept

Weather Visualization is a real-time generative artwork that transforms global weather data into a living, breathing abstract composition.
The system listens to live environmental parameters—temperature, humidity, wind, cloud density, and condition—and maps them onto:

color palettes (hot → red, cold → blue, rain → teal, snow → icy blue)

turbulence and movement

fractal deformation

density and flow of particles (rain/snow)

wind-driven distortion and motion vectors

The result is a continuously shifting visual “atmosphere” that mirrors the emotional texture of the weather.

🧠 Artistic Approach

This artwork treats meteorological data as an expressive material.
Instead of visualizing weather literally (icons, charts), it reframes it through the language of abstract expressionism, color field painting, and procedural art.

Influences include:

Mark Rothko’s emotional color spaces

Kandinsky’s dynamic compositions

Turbulence & noise structures in generative art

Atmospheric diffusion and organic forms in nature

The aim is to let viewers feel the weather rather than read it.
